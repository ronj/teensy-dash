YAFFUT -- YET ANOTHER FRAMEWORK FOR UNIT TESTING

Yaffut is a framework for C++ unit testing.  Unit testing
prevents you from shooting yourself in yaffut ;-)

The only file you need is yaffut.h, however there is also a GUI
front-end available: yaffut-gui.


GETTING YAFFUT

The latest version is available in bzr (http://bazaar-vcs.org) from

    bzr branch http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~yaffut/yaffut/yaffut.bzr

RUNNING

To test yaffut, do

    make check

this runs make all, ./yaffut-test or ./yaffut-gui ./yaffut-test
depending on whether the fox library is available.

EXAMPLES

See example.cpp for a full example, simple.cpp for even more simple
usage for those who are not afraid of macros.

PREREQUISITES

To compile, yaffut requires a standards conforming compiler and the
standard library.  The gui front-end requires fox and boost to
compile.

LIMITATIONS

SUNPRO is know not to allow the forced registration by taking the
address of the registrator static member.  It does allow the explicit
template instantiation as defined by the TEST and FUNC macro.

MSVC 6.0 appears to be limited by the compiler/linker in finding
duplicate registrator symbols.  MSVC 7.1 and the Express edition do
not suffer this behaviour.

Yaffut-gui is currently only available on *nix like platforms due to
the usage of a background shell execution of yaffut-test and named
pipes.
